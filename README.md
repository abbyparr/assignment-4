# assignment-4
a) The purpose of this program is to use loops under certain circumstances.
b) For question 1, the inputs are the integers. The inputs are the characters and passages for question 2. 
c) For question 1, the expected output is 'LCM' and 'GCF' and if the inputs are acceptable. For question 2, the output is the wanted character out of a passage. 
d) The executions are processor, compiler, assembler.
e) My program could improve in terms of efficiency. I was also having a lot of issues while getting an error for my inputs, saying it is a system error. I want to more deeply understand how the program works and how to use loops in certain cases.
